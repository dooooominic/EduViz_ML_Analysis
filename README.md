# EduViz_ML_Analysis

This is my final project for my Visualization for Machine Learning course at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, Fall 2025. I wanted to work with education data, of course, and I am using this project to practice all that I have learned from 0 CS knowledge this past summer to now, by cleaning up data, applying different machine learning concepts, training different classification and regression models I have learned, and creating visualizations in Streamlit in the form of a data dashboard. There is still a lot more to learn, but this is what I have so far!
